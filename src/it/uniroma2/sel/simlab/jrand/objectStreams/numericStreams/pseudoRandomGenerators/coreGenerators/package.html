Contains core generators of pseudorandom numeric stream. These generators are linear congruent,
multiplicative, etc, and they present intrinsic uniform distribution of integer values in subset
of the integer spectrum. These generators are used to implement pseudorandom generators of non-uniform
distributions, and of real values.
